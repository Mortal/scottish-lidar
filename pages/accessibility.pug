      | Compliance statement 
    p
      | Scottish Government is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public
      | Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018. This
      | accessibility statement applies to #[b remotesensingdata.gov.scot]. It was prepared on 7 February 2020. 
    p 
      | An accessibility expert provided informal advice for this website in December 2019. Many of the issues found were fixed.  
      | This website is partially compliant with the 
      | #[a(href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/") Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1]
      | AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

      | Non-accessible content 
    h3
      | Non compliance with the accessibility regulations 
    p
      | We plan to fix the following by June 2020:  
    ul
      li Some images do not have a text alternative (WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 non-text content).  
      li Some buttons do not have a description (WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 info and relationships). 
      li The tab structure for the pages are not obviously links (WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.3 sensory characteristics). 
      li Most of the links are identified using color alone (WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.1 use of color). 
      li Some text does not have enough contrast with the background color (WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.3 contrast: minimum). 
      li Some buttons do not have enough contrast with the background color (WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.11 non-text contrast). 
      li The hover-over tooltips do not persist when the pointer is over the tooltip text (WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.13 content on hover or focus). 
      li It is not possible to skip the main menu in each page to get straight to the page content (WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.1 bypass blocks). 
      li Some of the link text is not as clear as it could be for a screen reader (WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 link purpose (in context). 
      li Some buttons do not have the same programmatic name as that which is visible on the screen (WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.5.3 label in name). 
      li Some buttons are not named correctly so that the additional information they provide is hidden to some people (WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 name, role, value). 
      li The status messages are not clear for those using alternative technologies (WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.3 status messages). 
    p
      | We plan to fix the following by April 2021: 
    ul
      li Choosing and downloading the data is not possible using a keyboard alone (WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1.1 keyboard). 
      li On some internet browsers the focus indicator when using the keyboard to tab through the content is not very visible (WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.7 focus visible). 
    h3
      | Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations
    ul
      li
        | We have noticed that the bounding box used to filter to a desired dataset on the map page is
        | only operable using a mouse (WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.5.1 pointer gestures). This is under review.
